Algorithm for Checking Palindrome in Java
Initialize Variables:

Set left to 0.
Set right to the length of the word minus 1.
Looping Condition:

While left is less than right.
Comparison:

Compare character at index left with character at index right.
If not equal, return false.
Move Indices:

Increment left by 1.
Decrement right by 1.
Completion:

If loop completes, return true.
Output:

Call isPalindrome function with the word to check.
It Prints the result(string is palindrome or string is not palindrome).
